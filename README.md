  Under supervision of :

    Dr.Mahmoud Khalil


Motivation :

     Due to the current pandemic, many lecturers and tutors resolved to giving online or recorded classes. Many of
    which require illustrations to be used as visual aid alongside the tutor himself. Adding these illustrations can be difficult for some people.

Goals :

     The aim of our project is to provide an easy way to record and draw illustrations simultaneously. Using
    real-time hand tracking, you can now draw anything on the screen while you’re explaining. You can also draw  words and they will be     converted to regular text.
    
Strategy: 

    The project will be implemented using ##Python OpenCV , It will
    be divided into four parts:

        ▪ GUI : A desktop application will be made for interactions so that the program would be userfriendly.

        ▪ Hand-Detection : The program will start drawing depending on the position of the finger, so a hand detection phase must occur.

        ▪ Adding The Colors : After detecting the fingers’ position, a brush will follow the finger to commence drawing.

        ▪ Converting To Text : Upon request, the app will consider the drawing as words and will start converting it to text.
        
  Instructions of how to use the app: 
 1- Type the name of the video and choose it's saving location.
 2- Open the camera.
 3- Put an empty plain background (wall or a bed-sheet) inside the blue frame (don't put your hands).
 4- Capture the background.
 5- Put your hand inside the frame and put your pointer finger upwards and start drawing!
 6- To stop drawing, point all you fingers outwards.
 7- Save the video and enjoy :)
